A few of my classmates and I worked with the Reggie Harris 2023 Cincinnati City Council campaign. We collected, cleaned, and analyzed data to help assist him and his team. We also presented our findings to our peers throughout the year. These are for files Election Results, Magic Num, and Base Swing maps.
My class mates and I worked this summer with the Xavier Office of Institutional Research to create a profile of a hypothetical student that would potentially leave Xavier. This is in the GraphsPres file.
